## Review Nested 
Consider the following nested list: 
```
mat = [[18,9,13],
       [8,2,5,7],
       [6,15,3],
       [17,1]]
```

### Question 1
What is the value of `mat[1][2]`?

<br><br>


### Question 2
What is the value of `mat[0][-1]`?

<br><br>

### Question 3
What is the value of `mat[-2]`?

<br><br>

### Question 4
What is the value of `len(mat)`?

<br><br>

### Question 5
How would you access the second sublist of `mat`?

<br><br>

### Question 6
Write a line of code to print the number of items in the second sublist of `mat`.

<br><br>



### Question 7
Write a function that takes in a nested list of numbers,
like `mat` above and for each inner list computes the sum of the
inner list.  The function should return a list of the inner sums.

```
def compute_inner_sums(mat):
















```

### Question 8
Create a dictionary containing the keys 'christmas', 'new years', and 'memorial day'.
For each key, have the value be a list of people you spent that holiday with
(if no one, use an empty list).
