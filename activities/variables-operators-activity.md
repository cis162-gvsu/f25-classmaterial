### Part 1:
Describe in words and give one example of each of the following terms:
* algorithm<br><br>
* program<br><br>
* variable<br><br>
* function<br><br>
* operator<br><br>
* expression<br><br>
* Syntax Error<br><br>
* Type Error<br><br>
* comment<br><br>
* literal<br><br>
<br><br>


### Part 2
What is the output of the following code?

```
x = "hello"
y = "goodbye"
z = x + "+" + y
print(f'z = {z}')
```
<br><br><br><br>


### Part 3
What is the output of the following code?

```
w = 7
x = 2
y = 5.1
v = 9.7
z = x * y
print(int(z))
a = z / x
b = w % x
q = w**2
r = v // x
print(a)
print(b)
print(q)
print(r)
```
<br><br><br><br>

### Part 4
What is the output of the following code?

```
message = "hello fred -- how's your semester going so far?"
part_of_message = message[3:28]
part_of_message2 = message[6:-5:2]
part_of_part = part_of_message[::-1]
message = "dogs can't talk"
print(part_of_message)
print(part_of_message2)
print(part_of_part)
```
<br><br><br><br>



### Part 5
Many stores ask you if you would like to round up for charity on your bill.
Is there a math function available to you that would make this easier?
If so, can you demonstrate how to print a rounded up 
value provided in the variable `total_sale` in the code below?
```
import math

total_sale = 3.45
```
<br><br><br><br>

### Part 6
Write a piece of code that converts a given input in feet to kilometers.
Print the final result nicely.
You can use this as the start of your solution.
```
print(“Please enter a distance in feet.”)
feet = int(input())
```
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Part 7
Describe in a sentence what the following piece
of code calculates.  The best answer doesn’t 
say explicitly what line-by-line happens, but 
rather what the lines in total are accomplishing.

```
x = int(input()) 
y = 3.14
c = y * 2 * x
print(c)
```
<br><br><br><br>

### Part 8
Describe in a sentence what the following piece
of code calculates.  The best answer doesn’t 
say explicitly what line-by-line happens, but 
rather what the lines in total are accomplishing.
```
d = int(input()) 
m = 5280
print(d/m)
```
