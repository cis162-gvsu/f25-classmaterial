### Madlibs

Suppose you want to make a madlibs generator.


### Question 1
First, what would you need to do this?
E.g. any files, etc?

<br><br><br>


### Question 2
Without writing all of the code, how would you structure the code?
Would you have classes?  If so, what methods and instance variables
would they contain?
Would you have functions?
How would you store things?

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Question 3
Discuss with another group.
Share your proposed code breakdown
and learn about their proposed breadkown.

After talking with them, is there anything you would change?

<br><br><br><br><br>

### Question 4
Sketch out the skeleton code
(e.g. you don't have to implement all of the methods
if you don't want, but at least sketch out class,
constructor, and method signatures).
