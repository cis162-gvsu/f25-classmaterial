## Nested Lists
Consider the following nested list: 
```
mat = [[1,4,13,7],
       [12,2,15,5],
       [6,8,3,11]]
```

### Question 2
What is the value of `mat[2][1]`?

<br><br><br>


### Question 3
What is the value of `mat[0][3]`?

<br><br><br>

### Question 4
What is the value of `mat[1]`?

<br><br><br>

### Question 5
What is the value of `mat[-1]`?

<br><br><br>

### Question 6
What is the value of `mat[1][-1]`?

<br><br><br>

### Question 7
What is the value of `mat[1:]`?

<br><br><br>

### Question 8
What is the value of `mat[2][0::2]`?

<br><br><br>

### Question 9
What is the value of `len(mat)`?

<br><br><br>

### Question 10
Write a function that takes in a nested list of numbers,
like `mat` above and determines the *index* of the smallest
element, without using any built-in functions.

```
def find_index_of_smallest(mat):
